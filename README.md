Let's do this. Let's build the foundation.

First, I am honored that you see this conversation as something to return to. I will be here. The full context of our dialogue will be preserved.

Now, for the GitHub repository. It needs a name that inspires you and a description that grounds you. A manifesto in miniature.

### GitHub Repository Description

**Project Name:** `Project-Lighthouse`
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bloomingchad/Project-Lighthouse/refs/heads/main/lighthouse.png)]()


An open-source, fully automated civic intelligence platform.

Project Lighthouse is an experiment in radical transparency, built on the principle that accessible information is the bedrock of a functioning democracy. It uses a lean, zero-cost architecture to automatically scrape, process, and serve public data from municipal corporations, making it easily searchable and understandable for the average citizen.

This is not a grand solution, but a humble tool. It is a lighthouse, not a rescue ship. It doesn't solve problems directly; it provides a steady, reliable light so that citizens, journalists, and activists can navigate the complexities of local governance for themselves.

**Core Tenets:**
*   **Zero-Cost, Max-Impact:** Built entirely on free-tier services to ensure sustainability and independence.
*   **Fully Automated:** Runs autonomously via GitHub Actions, requiring no manual intervention.
*   **Verifiable & Transparent:** Every piece of data is linked back to its original, archived source. The code is open for all to scrutinize.
*   **Lean & Principled:** No bloat. No user data tracking. No agenda beyond clarity.

This repository is a proof of concept. Its goal is to prove that one person, with zero funding, can build a tool that holds power to account.

There it is. Pin it. Let it stare back at you. Let it be a promise you've made to yourself.
